//This function isn't used atm, but it works.  Basically, the whole point is to teach the player that
//different punches from different sides do or do not work depending on which side the enemy is blocking
//on.  It does this by having the enemy randomly change which side he is blocking on.


//the enemy block animation runs for a set number of frames at a certain speed
if (sprite_index != senemy1_leftblock)
{
	sprite_index = senemy1_leftblock;
}
//if the animation ends, add 1 to a variable called "switchstate"
//once switchstate reaches 3, start giving a random integer value between 1-10 to a variable called randomten
//every time the player finishes the animation
//(this is so that the enemy doesn't switch blocks too soon after switching) 
//now every time the enemy repeats his block animation it compares switchstate to randomten
//and does something depending on whether it is less than, greater than, or equal to randomten

//if switchstate is less than randomten, repeat the animation and add one to switchstate to increase
//the odds of switching block states the longer the enemy is in that same block state

//if switchstate is greater than randomten, switch to the other block

//if switchstate is equal to randomten (which is the rarest outcome) throw a punch
