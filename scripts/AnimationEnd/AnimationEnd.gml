//This is a function that you have to call any time you need to check whether or not an animation
//is finished.  You might be thinking "oh, well why can't you just check that by looking at 
//which frame the animation is on" and you would be right logically you should be able to do that
//but it doesn't work consistently so just use this.  It's good for when you need to switch player 
//and enemy states
